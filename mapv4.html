The first civil engineering chair was endowed by 1875 and its occupant, Charles MacMillan, founded the civil engineering department soon after. Cyrus Brackett, a physics professor, taught the first graduate course in engineering when he founded and lectured in the School of Electrical Engineering in 1889. <p>By 1912, there were enough civil and electrical engineers to form the Princeton Engineering Association, which promoted increased interest in engineering at Princeton. The University responded by forming the School of Engineering in 1921 under Dean Artuher Greene; four-year undergraduate programs were soon offered in civil, chemical, electrical, and mechanical and mining engineering. </p><p>The Engineering School moved into a home of its own in 1928 and for the next 34 years it resided in the Green Engineering Building (now Green Hall). By 1940, there were 379 engineering students and the concept of combining instruction in science and engineering fundamentals with liberal arts courses was well established.</p><p>In 1962,the School of Engineering and Applied Science, as it had come to be known, moved to the Engineering Quadrangle, which currently houses four of its six departments: Chemical and Biological Engineering, Civil and Environmental Engineering, Electrical Engineering, and Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering. Operations Research and Financial Engineering is across Olden Street in Sherrerd Hall. Computer Science occupies the building across Olden Street.</p><p>The School of Engineering and Applied Science is composed of six academic departments, one interdepartmental institute and a range of centers and programs that bring together people with a wide variety of expertise and interests.</p><p><a target='_blank' href='http://www.princeton.edu/engineering/'>princeton.edu/engineering</a></p>")
